*[maozedong.wiki](maozedong.wiki)* is aimed to share Mao Zedong's works including *Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung*, *Poems*,  
*Selected Military Writings of Mao Tse-tung* and etc.

Lots of people helped to finish this work ~~(not yet)~~, I show my treasure appreciation to them.  

All resources are collected form the Internet and this wiki only has Chinese now, because I've got some Chinese friends' help, there will be multi-lingual someday, though it is a **HUGE** work. 

The other version can be found at *[Marxists Internet Archive](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/index.htm)* and you can also translate by yourself, please leave an issue if you want to help, thanks. 

**Long live the people**
